I am currently conducting research under John Owens in the Parallel Computing Lab at UC Davis. My current research focuses
on leveraging RTX cores to accelerate the expensive ray marching/point sampling component of the NeRF training/inference 
pipeline.

Previously, I was the CTO at Sapien Network, where I worked on a social media product that leveraged web3 tools to create
hardened and portable reputation systems in order to filter the noise out of many online discussions.

Prior to that, I was a graduate student at UC Davis under John Owens, where my research focused on the intersection of
sparsity with deep learning. I focused on characterizing the effects of different sparse kernels on the latency of the
full neural network training loop, as well as the accuracy of neural networks. 

I have a wide variety of interests, but my main passion is in deep learning, and specifically applying deep learning
algorithms on robotic systems in real-world settings.
