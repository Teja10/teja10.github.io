I am currently pursuing a Masters Degree in Computer Engineering at UC Davis. My research interests are at the intersection
of General Purpose GPU Computing and Deep Learning. I am also keenly interested in autonomous systems and teach a senior
design at UC Davis on the subject of autonomous vehicles. I have also worked on numerous UAV projects in my free time.
