Lead TA for a new senior design course on the topic of autonomous systems. The focus of this year was on teaching students the necessary skills and tools to succeed in the self-driving car industry. Students learn topics for perception, localization, and control of autonomous vehicles in the first quarter. They also familiarize themselves with standard tools such as Docker, Github, and various Python/C++ libraries. In the second quarter, students work on specific problems in the self-driving industry such as lane line detection, and visual SLAM. As lead TA, I created lab materials and did the majority of lecturing during the first quarter. In the second quarter, I took on a project management role for each individual team where I lead weekly Agile meetings to keep students focused on completing a workable demo for their independent topics by the end of the 10 week quarter.
