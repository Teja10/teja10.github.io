This is a more generic version of the class I taught in 2018, with the focus on creating Artifical Intelligence systems. Students learn about convolutional neural networks for computer vision, kalman filtering for state estimation, as well as topics in control systems. As Lead TA, I lectured on topics in deep learning and kalman filtering/SLAM, as well as created lab material for these topics. In the second quarter I will be doing project management for a limited amount of students who plan on working on topics related to robotics.
